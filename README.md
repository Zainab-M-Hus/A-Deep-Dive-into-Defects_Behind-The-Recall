# A Deep Dive into Defects - Behind The Recall
This analysis investigates the product defects and recalls situation. With a specific focus on vehicles and equipment from 2010-2024 in the USA. It examines not only the volume of recalls over time but also the deeper factors behind them; defects, number of potentially affected products, component categories, safety risks and completion rates.

This data is captured from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): [https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Recalls-Data] and the dataset is cleaned to contain 13,306 rows (Recalls) and 14 columns. 

This project involved a detailed analysis of product recall data and processes within the automotive industry. The goal was to identify primary drivers and formulate strategic, actionable recommendations to mitigate recall events.

The investigation concluded that the single most critical variable is the potential number of affected products. The scale of a recall, driven by the volume of faulty components, directly determines its overall impact. Furthermore, the analysis identified that a significant majority of recalls originate from issues with key vehicle components and complex electrical or mechatronic systems.

Strategic Recommendations:
Enhance Proactive Quality Controls: Strengthen testing and use simulations to catch defects early, especially in high-risk areas.

Strengthen Supplier Oversight: Implement stricter and more frequent supplier audits to reduce defective components at the source.

Foster a Proactive Safety Culture: Build a company culture that prioritizes long-term safety and quality over short-term cost savings.

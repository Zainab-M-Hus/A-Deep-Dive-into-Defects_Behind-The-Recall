# A Deep Dive into Defects - Behind The Recall
This analysis investigates the product defects and recalls situation. With a specific focus on vehicles and equipment from 2010-2024 in the USA. It examines not only the volume of recalls over time but also the deeper factors behind them; defects, number of potentially affected products, component categories, safety risks and completion rates.

This data is captured from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): [https://datahub.transportation.gov/Automobiles/Recalls-Data] and the dataset is cleaned to contain 13,306 rows (Recalls) and 14 columns. 

This project involved a detailed analysis of product recall data and processes within the automotive industry. The goal was to identify primary drivers and formulate strategic, actionable recommendations to mitigate recall events.

The investigation concluded that the single most critical variable is the potential number of affected products. The scale of a recall, driven by the volume of faulty components, directly determines its overall impact. Furthermore, the analysis identified that a significant majority of recalls originate from issues with key vehicle components and complex electrical or mechatronic systems.

Strategic Recommendations:
To address these findings, the project proposes a multi-faceted strategy focused on prevention and systemic quality improvement:

Enhance Proactive Quality Controls: A primary recommendation is to strengthen in-house and supplier-level quality assurance. This involves implementing more rigorous testing protocols, particularly for high-risk areas such as electrical systems and core vehicle components. Utilizing advanced simulations and testing formalities can help identify potential defects earlier in the development cycle.

Strengthen Supplier Audit and Oversight: Given that components represent a majority of recall causes, improving the oversight of the supply chain is crucial. This involves conducting more frequent and stringent supplier audits to ensure their manufacturing and quality control processes meet required standards, thereby reducing the number of defective units entering the production line.
Cultivate a Safety-First Culture: Prioritize long-term brand integrity and safety over short-term cost savings to prevent defects from occurring.

Foster a Proactive Safety Culture: Beyond processes, building a corporate culture that intrinsically prioritizes safety and quality is essential. This means championing a mindset where long-term brand integrity and customer safety are valued over short-term cost savings.
